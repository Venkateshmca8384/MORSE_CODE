        <h1>MORSE_CODE</h1>
        <p class="first-word"> Morse code is a coding method that uses an arrangement of dashes, dots, and spaces. In the 19th century, scientists were keen on transmitting wireless signals. In its original form, it used spaces and dots to represent a few letters. However, the Morse code became so popular with time that in 1851 a new code was devised, which was later called as International Morse Code. The purpose was to use dots and dashes for all the letters and to make it more inclusive of other languages.
          With the MorseTranslator tool, you can easily translate any text into Morse code and Morse code into text. This translating tool also allows you to listen to the Morse code audio. To translate Morse code manually you'll need to have basic knowledge of dit/dots and dahs/dashes. These dits and dahs are similar to the alphabets in the English language.
          The Morse Code was invented in 1830 by Samuel F.B Morse to send wireless messages through signals over telegraph machines.</p>
        <p>
            Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.

International Morse Code encodes the 26 basic Latin letters a through z, one accented Latin letter , the Arabic numerals, and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals. There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit. Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits.

Morse code can be memorized and sent in a form perceptible to the human senses, e.g. via sound waves or visible light, such that it can be directly interpreted by persons trained in the skill. Morse code is usually transmitted by on-off keying of an information-carrying medium such as electric current, radio waves, visible light, or sound waves. The current or wave is present during the time period of the dit or dah and absent during the time between dits and dahs.

Since many natural languages use more than the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, Morse alphabets have been developed for those languages, largely by transliteration of existing codes.

To increase the efficiency of encoding, Morse code was designed so that the length of each symbol is approximately inverse to the frequency of occurrence of the character that it represents in text of the English language. Thus the most common letter in English, the letter e, has the shortest code: a single dit. Because the Morse code elements are specified by proportion rather than specific time durations, the code is usually transmitted at the highest rate that the receiver is capable of decoding. Morse code transmission rate is specified in groups per minute, commonly referred to as words per minute

        Morse code has been in use for more than 160 years — longer than any other electrical coding system. What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse. The Modern International Morse code, or continental code, was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Gerke changed nearly half of the alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes, International Morse Code was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Morse's original code specification, largely limited to use in the United States and Canada, became known as American Morse code or "railroad code". American Morse code is now seldom used except in historical re-enactments.

        <h2>Aviation</h2>

        <p>
          In aviation, pilots use radio navigation aids. To ensure that the stations the pilots are using are serviceable, the stations transmit a set of identification letters (usually a two-to-five-letter version of the station name) in Morse code. Station identification letters are shown on air navigation charts. For example, the VOR-DME based at Vilo Acuña Airport in Cayo Largo del Sur, Cuba is coded as "UCL", and UCL in Morse code is transmitted on its radio frequency. In some countries, during periods of maintenance, the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code (  ▄▄▄  ▄  ▄ ▄ ▄  ▄▄▄ ) or the code may be removed which tells pilots and navigators that the station is unreliable. In Canada, the identification is removed entirely to signify the navigation aid is not to be used. In the aviation service, Morse is typically sent at a very slow speed of about 5 words per minute. In the U.S., pilots do not actually have to know Morse to identify the transmitter because the dot/dash sequence is written out next to the transmitter's symbol on aeronautical charts. Some modern navigation receivers automatically translate the code into displayed letters.

        <h2>Amateur Radioa</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/VibroplexBug.jpg">
        <p>International Morse code today is most popular among amateur radio operators, in the mode commonly referred to as "continuous wave" or "CW". (This name was chosen to distinguish it from the damped wave emissions from spark transmitters, not because the transmission is continuous.) Other keying methods are available in radio telegraphy, such as frequency-shift keying.

          The original amateur radio operators used Morse code exclusively since voice-capable radio transmitters did not become commonly available until around 1920. Until 2003, the International Telecommunication Union mandated Morse code proficiency as part of the amateur radio licensing procedure worldwide. However, the World Radiocommunication Conference of 2003 made the Morse code requirement for amateur radio licensing optional. Many countries subsequently removed the Morse requirement from their licence requirements.
          
          Until 1991, a demonstration of the ability to send and receive Morse code at a minimum of five words per minute (wpm) was required to receive an amateur radio license for use in the United States from the Federal Communications Commission. Demonstration of this ability was still required for the privilege to use the HF bands. Until 2000, proficiency at the 20 wpm level was required to receive the highest level of amateur license (Amateur Extra Class); effective April 15, 2000, the FCC reduced the Extra Class requirement to 5 wpm. Finally, effective on February 23, 2007, the FCC eliminated the Morse code proficiency requirements from all amateur radio licenses.
          
          While voice and data transmissions are limited to specific amateur radio bands under U.S. rules, Morse code is permitted on all amateur bands — LF, MF, HF, VHF, and UHF. In some countries, certain portions of the amateur radio bands are reserved for transmission of Morse code signals only.
          
          Because Morse code transmissions employ an on-off keyed radio signal, it requires less complex transmission equipment than other forms of radio communication. Morse code also requires less signal bandwidth than voice communication, typically 100–150 Hz, compared to the roughly 2,400 Hz used by single-sideband voice, although at a slower data rate.
          
          Morse code is usually received as a high-pitched audio tone, so transmissions are easier to copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, and it can be used in very high noise / low signal environments. The fact that the transmitted power is concentrated into a very limited bandwidth makes it possible to use narrow receiver filters, which suppress or eliminate interference on nearby frequencies. The narrow signal bandwidth also takes advantage of the natural aural selectivity of the human brain, further enhancing weak signal readability.[citation needed] This efficiency makes CW extremely useful for DX (distance) transmissions, as well as for low-power transmissions (commonly called "QRP operation", from the Q-code for "reduce power"). There are several amateur clubs that require solid high speed copy, the highest of these has a standard of 60 wpm. The American Radio Relay League offers a code proficiency certification program that starts at 10 wpm.
          
          The relatively limited speed at which Morse code can be sent led to the development of an extensive number of abbreviations to speed communication. These include prosigns, Q codes, and a set of Morse code abbreviations for typical message components. For example, cq is broadcast to be interpreted as "seek you" (I'd like to converse with anyone who can hear my signal). om (old man), yl (young lady) and xyl ("ex-young lady" – wife) are common abbreviations. yl or om is used by an operator when referring to the other operator, xyl or om is used by an operator when referring to his or her spouse. qth is "transmitting location" (spoken "my Q.T.H." is "my location"). The use of abbreviations for common terms permits conversation even when the operators speak different languages.
          
          Although the traditional telegraph key (straight key) is still used by some amateurs, the use of mechanical semi-automatic keyers (known as "bugs") and of fully automatic electronic keyers is prevalent today. Software is also frequently employed to produce and decode Morse code radio signals. </p>

    <p>Whenever we heard about something,first question that comes to our mind is What? and Why?<br>
    So here we wanted to let you all know,<br>
    <br>
 <b> What is morse?</b><br>
  Morse code is a system of dots and dashes which when combined make meaningful words. It can be transmitted through light and sound signals. It can be understood quickly by a skilled person who knows the morse codes.<br>
 <br>
  <b>What is Morse code used For?</b><br>
Morse Code is still a famous way to send wireless messages long-distance for example in NAVY where water limits communication, or in intelligence where spies are taught to master the code in stressful situations. However, children learn it for fun sometimes. Code Talkers are the talk of the town, who have adopted Morse Code as a spoken language among their circles.<br>
<br>
 <b>How to write Morse code?</b><br>
Morse Code has its own alphabetical chart consisting of dots and dashes. When Morse Code was devised, it was made such that the letters with the most common occurrence in the English language were assigned the shorter code and vice versa. For example, the letter E is the most commonly occurring letter and hence is assigned a DOT "." and "-" as a "DASH". Morse_code_translator will help you learn, read and write Morse Code.<br>
<br>
 <b>How to read Morse code?</b><br>
In order to be able to read Morse code, an individual requires learning of the combinations of Dits and Dahs that make up alphabets, sentences, and paragraphs. Once you are an expert in identifying the dits, dahs, and spaces; it gets easier to read the Morse code.<br>
<br>
<b>How does Morse code work?</b><br>
Morse Code works with the combination of dits and dahs. Once dits and dahs are combined, they make alphabets. Once a Morse signal is transmitted, the "code talkers" can listen and identify between the words and sentences through the longer and shorter beeps.<br></p>
